# file-organizer

This project consists in a tool which helps users to organize file hierarchies based on when the files were created.

Let's use a practical example:
Suppose you have thousands of pictures: trips, parties, dinners with friends, etc. You have uncountable folders, and there is no order, simply a big mess.

With this tool you can move all files located in an given input folder to a well organized output folder using timestamps.
